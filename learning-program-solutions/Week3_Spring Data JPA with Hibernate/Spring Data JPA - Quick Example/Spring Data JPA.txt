Title: Spring Data JPA - A Quick Example with H2

This was the case with Spring Data JPA, before Spring Data JPA we had to do tedious configuration files in the form of either XMLs, or we had to type a whole bunch of code writing a whole bunch of Hibernate annotations so that our Java class could be mapped to the database table. A very boring of repetitive and error prone code, and we were really slow.

With the maturing of the ORM technologies, we evolve from Hibernate XML Configuration to Hibernate Annotations 

and now to Spring Data JPA, giving us:

-> Less boilerplate code

-> Cleaner and faster data access 

-> Auto-generated queries 

-> Basic CRUD operations supported out-of-box 

-> Support for in-memory databases like H2, as well as production databases like MySQL 

Think of it like spring data jpa is the WhatsApp of ORM - it works! You don't have to configure everything you did with SMS back then!!!
